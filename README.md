# Numbers to Words

A programme that converts numbers from 1 to 100,000 into words.

## Instructions

The challenge is called "Numbers"

Please create a small application that will convert numbers from 1 to 100,000 into words. It will need to include all punctuation and conjunctions.

The application will need to allow the user to input a range (start and end). If no range is provided, it should output the entire range above (1 to 100,000,000 in words)

Example use case:
The user enters a start “1000” and an end of “2222”.
The application will then output that range in words. For example:
One thousand
One thousand and one
One thousand and two
… etc.
… etc.
Two thousand, two hundred and twenty two
