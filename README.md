## Instructions

The challenge is called "Numbers"

Please create a small application that will convert numbers from 1 to 100,000 into words. It will need to include all punctuation and conjunctions.

The application will need to allow the user to input a range (start and end). If no range is provided, it should output the entire range above (1 to 100,000,000 in words)

Example use case:
The user enters a start “1000” and an end of “2222”.
The application will then output that range in words. For example:
One thousand
One thousand and one
One thousand and two
… etc.
… etc.
Two thousand, two hundred and twenty two

You have two hours from the sending of this email. Please return your application to this email within that time frame. You must include all files necessary to run the application.
